    <h2>Our Business Model</h2>
    <p>
      GalaxyCast Network, owned and operated independently by Amber Nikole Benway at 455 SE Barrington Dr, Oak Harbor, WA 98277, operates as an affiliate/referral platform. We help consumers find and compare broadband and cable services, then connect them with providers that serve their area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This is how we're funded:</strong> When you purchase a service through our referral, the service provider pays us a referral commission. This does not change your price — you pay the same rates available to the general public.
    </p>

    <h2>Affiliate Compensation Disclosure (FTC 16 CFR Part 255)</h2>
    <p>
      In compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's Guidelines Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising:
    </p>
    <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px", marginTop: "10px" }}>
      <li>We receive financial compensation from service providers when customers purchase through our referral links</li>
      <li>Our compensation may influence which services are more prominently featured on our website</li>
      <li>We strive to disclose this relationship clearly and honestly</li>
      <li>You pay the same price whether you go directly to the provider or through our referral</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Honest Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      Despite our affiliate relationships, our specialists aim to provide honest guidance based on your needs, location, and budget. We have a reputation to maintain with thousands of customers, and dishonest recommendations would harm our business long-term.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, we may recommend services from providers with which we have compensation agreements. We disclose this openly.
    </p>

    <h2>We Are Not a Provider</h2>
    <p>
      GalaxyCast Network is an independent third party. We do not claim to be an official website, representative, or employee of any internet service provider, cable company, or streaming platform. We operate entirely separately from all listed providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no authority to speak on behalf of any provider or make official agreements. All service terms are set by the provider, who is responsible for fulfilling the service agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All product names, logos, brands, trademarks, and registered trademarks mentioned on this website are the property of their respective owners and are used for identification and descriptive purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing & Availability Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      Information on our website including speeds, pricing, availability, and promotional offers:
    </p>
    <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px", marginTop: "10px" }}>

      <li>May change without notice</li>
      <li>May be unavailable in your specific service area</li>
