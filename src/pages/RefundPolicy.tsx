      GalaxyCast Network, owned and operated by Amber Nikole Benway at 455 SE Barrington Dr, Oak Harbor, WA 98277, is a free comparison and consultation service. We do not charge customers for our services. As such, there are generally no refunds associated with our platform.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Any services you purchase through our recommendations are provided by third-party service providers. Refunds, cancellations, and billing disputes for those services must be handled directly with the respective service provider according to their refund policies.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Role</h2>
    <p>
      GalaxyCast Network does not process payments for telecommunications services. We serve as a bridge connecting you with providers. All billing relationships are between you and the selected service provider.
    </p>
    <h2>Assistance</h2>
    <p>
      While we cannot process refunds on behalf of service providers, our team can assist you in understanding your options and guide you through the provider's cancellation or refund process. Contact Amber Nikole Benway at (888) 929-5895 or write to 455 SE Barrington Dr, Oak Harbor, WA 98277.
