    <h2>About GalaxyCast Network</h2>
    <p>
      GalaxyCast Network is an independent dealer of residential telecommunications services owned and operated by Amber Nikole Benway, based in Oak Harbor, WA. We are not directly affiliated with, employed by, or acting as an official agent of any specific internet service provider, cable company, streaming platform, or telecommunications carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our business model is straightforward: we help consumers compare services and connect them with providers that serve their area. When you complete a purchase through our referral, the service provider compensates us. You pay the same price you would going directly to them.
    </p>

    <h2>Affiliate & Compensation Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>We receive referral compensation from service providers when you purchase services through GalaxyCast Network.</strong> This does not increase your cost — you pay standard rates available to the general public. Our compensation is our business model and allows us to provide free comparison and consultation services.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disclosure is made in compliance with the FTC's Guidelines Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (16 CFR Part 255).
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The services, plans, pricing, and promotional offers described on this website are provided by third-party service providers. GalaxyCast Network facilitates the comparison and referral of these services. All trademarks, service marks, logos, and trade names referenced belong to their respective owners and are used for identification purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
    <p>
      While we make reasonable efforts to maintain accurate and current information, internet speeds, availability, pricing, promotional offers, and service terms may vary by location and are subject to change without notice. We update our database regularly but cannot guarantee real-time accuracy across all markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>You should verify availability and pricing directly with the service provider</strong> before committing to any service agreement. Service availability is ultimately determined by the provider's network coverage in your specific address.
    </p>

    <h2>Speed and Service Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
      GalaxyCast Network does not guarantee specific internet speeds, latency, uptime, service quality, or pricing. Actual performance depends on many factors including network infrastructure, equipment, usage patterns, and service provider policies. The service provider is responsible for fulfilling service terms defined in their service agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>Testimonials and Reviews</h2>
    <p>
      Customer testimonials and reviews on this site reflect genuine experiences. However, results vary based on location, service type selected, and individual circumstances. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
